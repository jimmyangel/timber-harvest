  <h3>About this site</h3>
  <p>This site is an interactive map used to visualize logging activities in National Forests and land managed by the Bureau of Land Management (BLM) within the state of Oregon. It also shows clearcut logging in private and State lands.</p>
  <p>Logging activities for a given National Forest and BLM District Office can be seen across all reported years, or within a given range of years, using a date range control. In addition, a timelapse animation can be visualized across all years reported, as well as within an arbitrary date range. Logged areas can be clicked to retrieve project details.</p>
  <p>A set of basemaps and overlays are available to customize the visualization.</p>

  <small><b>A note about data quality:</b> Logging spatial data are separately and independently reported by each National Forest and BLM office. Availability over date ranges varies considerably across offices and there can be significant omissions of logging activity, especially regarding older records. In addition, the most recent logging activities may not be shown. Last Update: {{lastUpdated}}</small>
