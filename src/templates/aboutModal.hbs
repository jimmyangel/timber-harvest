  <h2>Timber Harvest in Oregon's National Forests <span style="font-size: small;"><b>{{{version}}}</b></span></h2>
  <h3>About this site</h3>
  <p>This site is an interactive map used to visualize timber harvest activities in National Forests within the state of Oregon.</p>
  <p>Timber harvest activities for a given National Forest can be seen across all reported years, or within a given range of years, using a date range control. In addition, a timelapse animation can be visualized across all years reported, as well as within an arbitrary date range. Timber harvest areas can be clicked to retrieve project details.</p>
  <p>A set of basemaps and overlays are available to customize the visualization.</p>
  <h4>Data Sources</h4>
  <ul>
    <li><a href="https://data.fs.usda.gov/geodata/edw/datasets.php?xmlKeyword=Timber+Harvests">Timber Harvests Dataset</a> - United States Department of Agriculture, Forest Service</li>
    <li>Unharvested Forest Lands - Derived from Vegetation Stand datasets from individual National Forest offices</li>
  </ul>
  <small><b>A note about data quality:</b> Timber harvest spatial data are separately and independently reported by each National Forest office. Availability over date ranges varies considerably across offices and there can be significant ommisions of timber harvest activity, especially regarding older records.</small>
  <p>This project is <a href="https://github.com/jimmyangel/timber-harvest">open source</a> and uses open data.</p>
