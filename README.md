## Interactive map to visualize logging activities in Oregon

This is the code for [logging.oregonhowl.org](https://logging.oregonhowl.org/), an interactive map to visualize logging activities in the state of Oregon.

The application shows logging records in public lands managed by the U.S. Forest Service (USFS) and the Bureau of Land Management (BLM) as well as clearcutting in private and State lands. A timelapse animation can be used to visualize across all years recorded, as well as within an arbitrary date range. Logged areas can be clicked to retrieve project details.</p>

A set of basemaps and overlays are available to customize the visualization.
