## Interactive map to visualize National Forest timber harvest data

This is the code for [timber-harvest.oregonhowl.org](https://timber-harvest.oregonhowl.org/), an interactive map to visualize logging activities in National Forests within the state of Oregon.

Logging activities for a given National Forest can be seen across all reported years, or within a given range of years, using a date range control. In addition, a timelapse animation can be visualized across all years reported, as well as within an arbitrary date range. Logging areas can be clicked to retrieve project details.

A set of basemaps and overlays are available to customize the visualization.
